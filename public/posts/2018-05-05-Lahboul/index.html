	<p>Welcome to Lahboul<br>
Take in the sights<br>
Of fools, ghouls, and tools<br>
Without any rights</p>
<p>You can shield your eyes and ears<br>
As you try desperately to blend<br>
But your mere existence incites fear<br>
Your futile urban camouflage amounts to a dead end</p>
<p>Creatures that look, talk, and walk the same<br>
Pounce on the strange and exotic<br>
And on those who do not play their game<br>
Their world becoming jarringly chaotic</p>
<p>But donâ€™t denigrate these mammals<br>
For in the face of the unknown, failing to be cool<br>
For we are all animals<br>
In our own versions, of Lahboul</p>
<p><em>I walked by a beautiful park near every day when I studied abroad in Meknes, Morocco. Supposedly, there was a zoo somewhere tucked away in the</em>
<em>sprawling gardens. I saw very few animals walking by that park. Definitely not enough to warrant a zoo. But that didn&rsquo;t stop everyone from</em>
<em>finding something to leer at.</em>
<em>Many students at the center where I studied talked about how locals would stare at them when they walked around in groups.</em>
<em>Women, Black students, Asian students, and gender non-conforming students experienced gawking more frequently and intensely just like they do</em>
<em>in the states. Conversely, I remember students doing the same to local Moroccans during our study abroad particularly when we first arrived.</em>
<em>Culture shock hits us all when we travel, especially those used to being a minority.</em></p>
