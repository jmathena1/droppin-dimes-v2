		<h2>Survivors march down Hilton</h2>
		<p>October 3, 2020</p>
	</div>
	<p>Their hearts heavy<br>
Heads high<br>
Watched over<br>
By loved ones lost</p>
<p>Strivers march down hilton<br>
Their fists raised<br>
Waving in the crisp fall air<br>
Cheered on<br>
By residents passing by</p>
<p>Believers march down hilton<br>
Their spirits wounded<br>
But ever so alive<br>
Chanting those magic words<br>
Enough is Enough</p>
<p><em>I attended a peace walk on Hilton Road that started around Green Street Academy in southwest Baltimore. I represented the State&rsquo;s Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Southwestern Police District at the time. We ended the walk standing in front of Freddy P March&rsquo;s Funeral Home, where both my granparents held their viewings. Although gun violence did not take my grandparents, being back at the home returned a strong feeling of loss. Yet how beautiful it was to see so many people so passionate about using their loved ones&rsquo; memories to motivate their fight to make those deaths the last of their kind.</em></p>
